# Miami Dade County Progress

As a note the name for this is temp and will change it if and when I come up with a better one, I am not very good at naming things. I will likely also move this to a repo of its own at some point. This is also in it current state very much a work in progress.

This folder contain a set of geojson areas describing what area I have done what in and what area need what work.

This will be structure (for now) as follows:

 - [description.md](/Miami%20Dade%20County%20Progress/description.md), this file contains a list of links to geojson files and what each represents along with an explanation of the meaning of each key value pair within the geojson file it links to
 - multiple geojson files containing various areas that I have done or not done various types of work in.
