# Readme

This folder contains the files I created for [task #876](https://tasks.openstreetmap.us/projects/876) on the OSMUS tasking manager. Within you will find a combination of images (for examples), markdown file describing various aspects and geojson files with the various areas that were used for the task. 

## markdown

below is a list of the markdown files in created for this project and what they are for:

 - [instructions.md](/tasking%20manager/pedestrian%20feature%20addition%201/instructions.md), this contains the general instructions text you see when you start contributing.
 - [instructions validators.md](/tasking%20manager/pedestrian%20feature%20addition%201/instructions%20validators.md), is linked from [instructions.md](/tasking%20manager/pedestrian%20feature%20addition%201/instructions.md) and contains more specific requests for validators to follow when validating tasks.
 - [description.md](/tasking%20manager/pedestrian%20feature%20addition%201/description.md), this file contains the general description you see of the project before starting work on a perticular task.

## geojson

below is a list of the geojson files in created for this project and what they are for:

 - [area for sidewalks.geojson](/tasking%20manager/pedestrian%20feature%20addition%201/area%20for%20sidewalks.geojson), this is the area that the projects tasks are within
 - [priority area.geojson](/tasking%20manager/pedestrian%20feature%20addition%201/priority%20area.geojson), this is the area that should currently be prioritized
 - [heavy tree cover.geojson](/tasking%20manager/pedestrian%20feature%20addition%201/heavy%20tree%20cover.geojson), this represents the area that has relatively high tree cover so esri imagery should be used along with street side imagery, the tasks in this area are allot harder because of the density of tree cover.
 - [areas still needing alignment work.geojson](/tasking%20manager/pedestrian%20feature%20addition%201/areas%20still%20needing%20road%20alignment%20work.geojson), this represents the small area that still needs road alignment work (I try to get all the roads aligned before starting work on pedestrian features) but shouldn't be to hard to do in tandem as this area isn't as complicated as other surrounding it.
