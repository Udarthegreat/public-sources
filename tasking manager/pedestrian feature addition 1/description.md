The goal for this project is to complete a first pass of adding separately mapped pedestrian features in this part of Miami Dade County. There will likely be future passes done that add more detail to the pedestrian network, for now the hope is that a basic level of navigation will be available throughout this area which connects several other islands of pedestrian data to the north and south together.
